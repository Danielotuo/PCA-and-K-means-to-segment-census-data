# PCA-and-K-means-to-segment-census-data
PCA prior to K-means is a powerful method for revealing featurelevel similarities in the data.

Revealing unseen patterns and generalizing those
patterns onto observations is precisely why
techniques like PCA and K-means are essential. This
project was done with a basic question in mind: Can 
the US census population be segmented based on its
features like income, ethnicity, mode of
transportation etc.? Reducing all those features down
to principal components and then clustering the
principal components using k-means hints that the
answer to the question is likely
